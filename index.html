            <h1>Variables and Data Types</h1>
            <p>In programming, a variable is like a container that holds data. Declaring a variable tells the program to create this container. You can also assign a value to the variable when you declare it. This process reserves memory space for the variable. It helps the program know what kind of data the variable will store.</p>

            <h1>Input and Output</h1>
            <p>Input and Output (I/O) are essential in programming because they allow a program to exchange information with the outside world. Input lets the program receive data from users, files, or other sources. This data can then be processed by the program. Output allows the program to send data back out, like displaying results on the screen or saving information to a file. I/O is crucial for making a program interactive and useful.</p>

            <h1>Conditional Statements</h1>
            <p>Conditional statements are a key part of programming that help the program make decisions. They check if a condition is true or false. Based on the result, the program can run different sections of code. This gives the program the ability to adapt and respond in different situations. Conditional statements are important for adding logic and flexibility to a program.</p>

            <h1>Looping Statements</h1>
            <p>Looping statements are a basic concept in programming that help repeat a task. They let the program run a block of code over and over as long as a condition is true. Loops save time and effort by automating repetitive tasks. Instead of writing the same code multiple times, a loop can handle it. They make programs more efficient and easier to manage.</p>
